# EspHome Digital Pixel Clock
We needed a clock for in the livingroom, but I also wanted the ability to display custom text or values from sensors in out current Home Assistant environment. Had an old wemos d1 and some max7219 pixels (4 displays) laying around.

#### Hardware
Wemos d1 mini (esp8266 based)  
Max7219 32x8 Pixel display (https://www.tinytronics.nl/shop/nl/verlichting/matrix/led-matrix-32x8-met-max7219-module)  
3D Printed housing (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3256141)  
I added a mirror sticker on the front (optional)  

#### EspHome code
esp_pixelclock.yaml
